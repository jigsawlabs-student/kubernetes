In the deployment configuration files, we specify what image we want running and the number of replicas we prefer.  Kubernetes will then work to implement create the specified number of containers across the machines that are available.  So how does this happen?"

    "* **Kubernetes API:** We use the Kubernetes API whenever we type in `kubectl` to use the command line interface.  The Kubernetes API lets us query and manipulate the state of API objects in Kubernetes.  For example, when we run `kubectl -f apply api-deployment.yaml` we passing our configuration file to the API to update our deployment.\n",

The master is in charge of determining and what changes to make, and where (on which computers) they should be made.

So after the master determines where to update the new pods, it sends instructions to the relevant nodes to perform the update. Thes nodes perform the work, and tell the master when the task is completed.  \n",

It keeps an in memory cache of the intention and the actual state (etcd), and then has a simple loop that then notices when the actual and desired state differs, it kicks off an action to rectify this.\n",

The scheduler notices that there is a new pod that has not been scheduled, and runs an algorithm to determine the best node for that pod.  The scheduler then tells the API server what node the pod should be created on.  And the API server will update the desired state of the pods across it's nodes.  And the nodes will take action."
